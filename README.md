Welcome to **Github Frens** â€” an open-source project designed to connect developers in a fun and engaging way!. The goal is to show a visually appealing interface with interactive node features where users can view other gihub users and repos they have worked with or are currently working with.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: A simple sign-in system with github for users to log in and then view your fellow contrtibutors.
  
- **UI Nodes**: The main UI is composed of a **Node** component which shows the current user github pfp, and the the overview of the contributors when hovered on. the main pfp is connected to a web of toher nodes where each is a project that user has worked with

- **Hover Interaction**: When hovering over the last avatar, a **HoverCard** appears, revealing all the contributors' names and link to their git page.
